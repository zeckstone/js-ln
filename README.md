**JS-LN**

I created this repo to serve as a reference guide for commonly used ***JavaScript*** concepts. For those preparing for an interview, you may find the concepts useful.

**Running the scripts**
1. Be sure you have node installed on your device. You can check by entering this command in your terminal `node -v` or `node --version`.
2. If you don't have node installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
3. To run any of the scripts (e.g. algorithm.js), run `node <script name>`. For example `node algorithm.js` runs the algorithm.js script. This should print the output in the terminal.
